            We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore
            where the design works well and where it can be improved. We focus
            our process around one central question: “What can we do to make
            this design more efficient?”

                <h4>A picture is worth a thousand words</h4>
                <p>
                  Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell
                  you what can be improved but also make revamps to the most
                  critical parts of the design.

                <h4>Design Report </h4>
                <p>
                  We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and provide
                   a detailed visual report with useful tips and design hacks. This would be
                    the starting point for further work on the design.

                <h4>Ways to Redesign</h4>
                <p>
                  We provide several strategies for further redesign by various contractors,
                   from freelancers to high-end agencies. We provide you with an assessment 
                   of the timing and cost for both a full redesign and quick but effective 
                   improvements.
